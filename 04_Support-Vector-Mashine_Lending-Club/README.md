using Python and Scikit-learn to apply Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification to a real world use case:
- the famous [Iris flower data set](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set) or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by Sir Ronald Fisher in the 1936 as an example of discriminant analysis
- consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor)
- based on four features (details below), the respective species will be predicted using a SVM

This data set contains the following features:
- sepal length in cm
- sepal width in cm
- petal length in cm
- petal width in cm
